# Odin Recipes

This project is part of The Odin Project Foundations curriculum.
The goal of this project is to build a basic recipe website using only HTML.

By completing this project, I will demonstrate:
- Creating multiple HTML pages
- Using links to navigate between pages
- Structuring content with headings, lists, and paragraphs
- Organizing files and directories
- Using Git and GitHub for version control
